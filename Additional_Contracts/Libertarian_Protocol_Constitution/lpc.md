# The Libertarian Protocol Constitution (LPC)
*Version 1.0*

---

## Section 1: Definitions

- **Contract**: A digital agreement between one or more parties, voluntarily signed, which defines shared rules, expectations, responsibilities, and procedures for dispute resolution.
- **Party**: A natural or juridic entity that has signed a specific version of a contract.
- **Juridic Entity**: An organization, business, collective, or representative structure that signs contracts on behalf of a legal framework. All juridic entities must be transparently identifiable.
- **Version**: A distinct, immutable instance of a contract, created when any modification is made to an earlier contract. All versions must include a changelog and clearly state what remains compatible with prior versions.
- **Forking**: The process of creating a new version of a contract or of this Constitution. Forks do not invalidate prior versions and participation in a forked version is always voluntary.
- **Bridge Contract**: A specific form of contract designed to govern interactions between parties operating under different contracts. Used to handle cross-contract disputes, collaborations, or shared environments.
- **Contract Category**: The domain or type under which a contract falls, such as civil, criminal, commercial, marital, or social. Each contract must declare a category. If none applies, it must declare itself as 'Unspecified'. Each category may define different norms for adjudication and evidence.
- **Judgment**: The process of resolving a contract violation, to be carried out either by individuals who are signatories to the same contract version, or — if explicitly stated within the contract — by signatories of a relevant contract category. However, the category contract must not contradict the invoking contract's terms, and participation in judgment remains voluntary.
- **Penalty**: A restorative action defined within a contract, agreed upon in advance, and intended to resolve harm or breach. Penalties must be restorative, not punitive.
- **Identity Provider**: A trusted third-party entity that verifies the identity of a natural or juridic person. Contracts that require identification must declare the Identity Provider used, and that entity is accountable for the validation.
- **Identity Layer**: The minimum proof-of-personhood required to participate in a specific contract role (e.g., judge, claimant, validator). Roles of higher consequence require stronger identity verification.
- **Territory Ledger**: A blockchain-based registry of physical property claims, landscapes, and space usage, used to resolve disputes related to property.
- **Foundational Contract**: A minimal fallback contract that offers basic definitions of bodily safety, freedom from coercion, and preservation of agency, which any person may rely on even if they reject all other contracts.

## Section 2: Valid Contracts — Structure, Rules, and Lifecycle

To be valid under the Libertarian Protocol Constitution, a contract must fulfill the following structural and procedural criteria:

1. **Explicit Consent**  
   Every signer must opt-in freely and consciously. No contract is valid if signed under threat, deception, survival necessity, or coercion.

2. **Finite Duration or Clear Exit Clause**  
   All contracts must include conditions for exit or termination. Permanent or indefinite agreements are not permitted.

3. **No Consensual Non-Consent**  
   Contracts may not override an individual's basic rights to life, liberty, or agency. No person may validly sign away their freedom, bodily autonomy, or identity.

4. **Defined Contract Category**  
   Every contract must declare a contract category (e.g., civil, penal, social). If none apply, it must be marked as 'Unspecified'.

5. **Dispute Resolution Clause**  
   Contracts must specify how and by whom disputes will be resolved. If relying on a category contract for judgment, the contract must state this explicitly and ensure compatibility with that category.

6. **Identity Requirements**  
   If identity validation is required, the contract must declare its chosen Identity Provider(s). These providers bear shared responsibility in the event of fraudulent claims.

7. **Versioning and Change Logs**  
   Any alteration to a contract must result in a new version. The new version must include:
   - A changelog describing what changed,
   - A rationale for the change,
   - A statement of what remains the same,
   - Examples to illustrate interpretation.

8. **Encrypted or Private Terms**  
   Contracts with confidential content may still be valid if registered with a public hash on-chain, while terms remain accessible only to involved parties and specified arbiters.

9. **Compatibility Clause**  
   Contracts relying on other contracts (e.g., for judgment) must ensure their terms do not contradict the referenced contracts.

10. **Fallback to Foundational Contract**  
    If a contract fails or dissolves without resolution, signers may rely on the Foundational Contract as a temporary safeguard while a new agreement is negotiated.

11. **Language Clause**  
    Contracts may be authored in any language. However, an English version must accompany each contract and will serve as the primary reference in the event of disputes. If significant discrepancies exist between the original and English versions, the contract may be voided or considered to have been issued in bad faith.

## Section 3: Arbitration and Judiciary Protocols

The resolution of disputes under this Constitution must reflect the principles of voluntarism, clarity, and accountability.
